## Kris Wright ##

Software engineer at Mozilla. I do threading, tooling, and other fun things that sometimes start with the letter T but not always. Find me as :kriswright on most Mozilla things.

Website built with jekyll. I know nothing about post-2004 web design. Thank you to the amazing people out there who do. Leaving the kernel is scary and mysterious.
